# fixing-charts-example
A Lab assignment completed in the Data Science course at Johns Hopkins University. We take some bad charts and make them better!

Each chart here was taken out of context and (generally) without backstory. The idea here was to look at any given chart and create a better one from it.

Every chart includes an explanation of what the original intended message of the chart was, what kind of quantitative relationship in the data that the chart was tyring to convey, why the original chart failed to do this, alternatives that could be considered, and a chart made from these considered alternatives.
